                <hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden; margin: 0px;" />
                Tarleton’s current work investigates how social media platforms and other algorithmic information systems shape public discourse. His latest book, <i>Custodians of the Internet: Platforms, Content Moderation, and the Hidden Decisions that Shape Social Media</i> (Yale University Press, 2018) examines how the content guidelines imposed by social media platforms set the terms for what counts as ‘appropriate’ user contributions, and ask how this private governance of cultural values has broader implications for freedom of expression and the character of public discourse. The book was a finalist for the 2019 PROSE Award from Association of American Publishers (AAP).

                Professor Perona is currently interested in visual recognition, more specifically visual categorization. He is studying how machines can learn to recognize frogs, cars, faces and trees with minimal human supervision, and how machines can learn from human experts. His project `Visipedia' has produced two smart device apps (iNaturalist and Merlin Bird ID) that anyone can use to recognize the species of plants and animals from a photograph.
                <hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden; margin: 0px;" />
                In collaboration with Professors Anderson and Dickinson, professor Perona is building vision systems and statistical techniques for measuring actions and activities in fruit flies and mice. This enables geneticists and neuroethologists to investigate the relationship between genes, brains, and behavior. Professor Perona is also interested in studying how humans perform visual tasks, such as searching and recognizing image content. One of his recent projects studies how to harness the visual ability of thousands of people on the web.
