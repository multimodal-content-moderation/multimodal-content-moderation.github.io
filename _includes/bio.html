                Sarah uses a sociotechnical lens to explore peoples’ experiences using online platforms. Her work has covered key areas such as motivations, informal learning, privacy and ethics, and online governance. To this end she uses a variety of methods, from qualitative ethnography and in-depth interviews, to quantitative surveys and social network analysis. Currently, she is the Research Director at the Citizens and Technology (CAT) Lab, founded by Dr. J. Nathan Matias, and leading the NSF-funded project, Learning Code(s): Community-Centered Design of Automated Content Moderation with along with PIs, Drs. Katie Shilton, Hal Daumé III, and Michelle Mazurek. Prior to that, she graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2018 advised by Drs. Caroline Haythornthwaite and Luanne Freund and worked as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Maryland on the NSF funded PERVADE (Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research) project with Drs. Katie Shilton and Jessica Vitak.

                Susanna Ricco is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google DeepMind where she leads a team dedicated to advancing fairness and inclusion for multimodal AI models and systems. Her research centers around computational techniques designed to responsibly and faithfully model human perception of demographic, cultural, and social identities across various modalities. As part of an interdisciplinary team of researchers, she pioneers new approaches to model development, leading to higher quality, more controllable, more inclusive output, while reducing behaviors that reinforce harmful stereotypes. The team's work has contributed to improvements that make Google products work better for everyone, benefiting Google Photos, Nest, Search, YouTube, and more. Before joining Google in 2013, she earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University. She was a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and is also a proud alum of Harvey Mudd College.

                Manuel’s research is centred around the risks and promises of large ML models for human-centered AI. I expore how to leverage the capabilities of these models’ for the best while accounting for and mitigating the issues arising from large-scale training. Latest advances in deep learning have been highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets randomly scraped from the internet. In my research I investigate what models actually learn during pre-training and how to measure and utilize the model's representations. With the goal of improving how we as humans interact with AI systems, making the AI align with the behavior us humans expect from the system.
