                Sarah uses a sociotechnical lens to explore peoples’ experiences using online platforms. Her work has covered key areas such as motivations, informal learning, privacy and ethics, and online governance. To this end she uses a variety of methods, from qualitative ethnography and in-depth interviews, to quantitative surveys and social network analysis. Currently, she is the Research Director at the Citizens and Technology (CAT) Lab, founded by Dr. J. Nathan Matias, and leading the NSF-funded project, Learning Code(s): Community-Centered Design of Automated Content Moderation with along with PIs, Drs. Katie Shilton, Hal Daumé III, and Michelle Mazurek. Prior to that, she graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2018 advised by Drs. Caroline Haythornthwaite and Luanne Freund and worked as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Maryland on the NSF funded PERVADE (Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research) project with Drs. Katie Shilton and Jessica Vitak.

                Professor Hirschberg has analyzed the prosody of charismatic and deceptive speech and developed a computer system that is more successful than humans at detecting lies. She studies entrainment— the tendency of people to mirror back the spoken mannerisms of those who are speaking to them—in voice-response systems. Hirschberg also does research on emotional speech, code-switching, and text-to-speech synthesis. Hirschberg received a BA from Eckerd College in 1968 and a PhD in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1985. She also received a PhD in history from the University of Michigan in 1976. She holds six patents for text-to-speech synthesis and audio browsing/retrieval. She is a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the International Speech Communication Association, the Association for Computational Linguistics, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and is a founding fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics. She was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2017 and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2018.

                Adina is a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research in NYC (started October 2018). Previously, she earned her PhD at New York University in the Department of Linguistics, where she investigated the brain basis of syntactic and semantic processing. Her main research goal is to strengthen the connections between linguistics and cognitive science on the one hand and natural language processing and artificial intelligence on the other. She approaches this process from both directions: she brings linguistic and cognitive scientific insights about human language to bear on training, evaluating, and debiasing NLP systems, and applies statistical methods and corpus analytic tools from NLP to uncover new quantitative, cross-linguistic facts about particular human languages.
